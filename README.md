# Proof of concept implementation of regularized Gaussian Distribution in CUQIpy

This repository contains an initial implementation of the regularized Gaussian Distribution within CUQIpy. This code is used and discussed in the PhD thesis of Jasper Marijn Everink.

The Python notebook [showcase.ipynb](showcase.ipynb) contains a bunch of examples of models shown in Chapter 5 of the thesis.

This version of the code is an extension to CUQIpy, specifically commit [0b6bc36](https://github.com/CUQI-DTU/CUQIpy/tree/0b6bc3638b8ac5864be55e981d7b19efcfd532aa), and can also be found [here](https://github.com/jeverink/CUQIpy/tree/14784c7a483accb92a4f67d1517f8808639e3f4a).
